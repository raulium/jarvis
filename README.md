# jarvis 2.0
personal home automation solution

## Goal
To develop a master control program that would automate my schedule, as well as take care of things around the house. For example:
* Turn on the porch lights and inside lights at sunset
* Turn off the porch lights at sunrise
* Water my lawn appropriately
* Be a smart alarm by knowing my schedule (don't wake me up if I don't have work, don't let me sleep in if I have an early meeting, etc)

## Getting Started
Don't. Just don't. Not right now, at least.  This requires a config.py module for all the working bits (api keys to online services, file paths, etc). As soon as this is in a more stable form, I'll have to post it.

## Dependencies
Exhaustive list of python libraries needed

* google-api-python-client
* speech_recognition
* subprocess
* time
* random
* BeautifulSoup
* urllib
* Flask
